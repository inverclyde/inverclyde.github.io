      What to Watch Out for When Hiring a Wedding Disc Jockey

It's desperation of every couple engaged and getting married that their guests feel welcome, relaxed and entertained on their big day, which explains why great entertainment is essential to the success of the wedding reception.  One of the most useful and most financially responsible decisions a married relationship coordinator may make is to employ a professional wedding DJ who is able to do so much more than simply provide musical entertainment in the reception.  But just how do a coordinator be sure they've found the most beneficial?  Here are a few things to look out for when hiring a married relationship disc jockey.
The first thing to watch out for is the source that the DJ was found.  For example, be wary from a DJ which team you found on Craigslist or possibly a similar classified advertisement site.  Anyone can advertise on these websites without having their skills and work experience verified and accredited.  It's much wiser to search out talent from a reputable agency with a lot of years of experience promoting wedding DJs because they're held accountable to the skills and reliability of the DJ they promote.  With their reputation on the line, they are going to do everything they are able to to ensure they are only utilizing the highest quality and most professional disc jockeys around.  
After you've consulted an established agency and located a few DJs in your town that seem promising, the second thing to take into consideration is the DJ's history.  You're hunting for a DJ with all the happiest clients and longest good performing at weddings like yours, therefore it is in your best interest to book a face-to-face meeting with a number of prospects as quickly as possible.  During those meetings, you are able to ask for a listing of past clients' contact information.  Be wary of any DJ who hesitates to provide a list upon request.  Call a couple of past clients and conduct further research with the DJ's website, Facebook or another online profile pages.  If it is difficult to find positive reviews or if multiple previous clients give you negative feedback &ndash; it's time to look elsewhere.  
The third major thing to consider are hidden fees for services you did not agree to.  When you've found a fantastic DJ who are able to provide all in the services you would like, it's important to get a quote in the DJ that itemizes everyone of those services, taking into account the total size your event space.  These services do range from adding uplighting, to narrating a photo or video presentation, to providing an image booth, etc.  Once a final contract has been drawn up and is also ready to sign by both parties, study it carefully and turn into certain solutions is listed and you really are not being charged for whatever you did not request.  
Watch out for these simple things and you're sure to hire no-one but the top wedding disc jockey available.
