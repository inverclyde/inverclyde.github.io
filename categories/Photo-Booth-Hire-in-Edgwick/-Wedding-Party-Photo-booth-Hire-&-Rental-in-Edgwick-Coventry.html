      How to Make Money with Arts and Crafts by Ernest Kent - ArticleCity.com

I are actually to many arts and craft fairs and festivals inside my life and there?s on thing I notice in every of them. They are busy. If you pay attention to what?s taking place at these fairs and festivals, you?ll realize that people buy these crafts. I thought to myself ?Why can?t I try this?? Well, guess what, I can try this and I do. 

Let me let you know how I began in doing arts and crafts. After I visited many of the arts and crafts fairs and festivals, I went home and decided find some good e-books on making arts and crafts. The first e-book I got was about soap making. I got this e-book because on the last arts and crafts festival I was at, the soaps was the greatest sellers. I read the e-book and learned steps to make soap. I got to function on making soap for your nest arts and craft festival. I didn?t desire to make a lot of soap at first for nervous about not selling everything. Well, I made about 100 bars of soap and asked an associate if I sell at his book. He said yes. I wound up selling 75 bars of soap. I created a nice little profit from selling the soap. 

After that arts and crafts festival, I went home and got a few more e-books. I got about gel candle making, bath salt making and perfume making. I read each of the e-books but happened to be busy with making more soap, and I begun to make perfume, bath salt and gel candles. With the research that I did when you go to the arts and crafts fairs and festival, I found out that which was hot to market now. 

Anyway, I went back to another arts and crafts festival and ended up getting my own, personal booth. I wound up selling almost 10 bars of soap, selling every one of the bath salt I made, selling almost 1 gel candle and I sold all perfume I made. That weekend I made about $500 with only setting up $100 in products. I was happy. So I went home and ended up get another e-book. I got making a wind chime e-book. Well, to generate this long story short, I read the e-book made some wind chimes for one more arts and crafts festival. I finished up selling all of the wind chimes.
