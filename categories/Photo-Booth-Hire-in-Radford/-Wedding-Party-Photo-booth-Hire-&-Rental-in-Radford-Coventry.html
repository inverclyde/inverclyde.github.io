'You obtain the guest book stuffed with lasting memories at the end of your wedding dinner providing you with photos from the wedding right away,' says Brittney with PicBox Photo Booth Company.
Many people remember the days when instant photo booths were everywhere. From carnivals to stores, theatres to sidewalks, those large boxes with all the pull curtain and single seat produced strips of candid pictures which are later pinned to bulltinboards or tucked into wallets or scrapbooks. Today, those clever booths have entered the digital age and found a new life adding an enjoyable and memories to receptions.
Photo booths are around for rent from companies and independent entrepreneurs. The booth is delivered to the reception and placed at the entrance or in another easily accessible location.

Some welcome options could include:
If something with unlimited photos is selected, wedding guests can visit the booth time and again throughout the reception, and in the end, there'll be a wealth of amazing pictures to cherish. PicBox, along with most photo booth rental companies, offer a variety of packages to match with most couples budgets and wanted options; their listing of options are quite extensive.
The keepsake photos are a good enough reason to consider a photograph booth rental for your reception, but they aren't the one reason. Photo booths do over take pictures. They create excitement and camaraderie among guests. They break the ice for guests who don't know the other person. They entertain both new and experienced alike.
