      2010 Wedding Trends

     Colors, themes and fashions can change year to year in weddings. It used to be that wedding styles didn't change much from year to year. It was normal for all of the bridesmaids to own matching dresses along with the groomsmen all wore tuxedos. The wedding industry has changes drastically during the last couple of decades. If you are planning on having a wedding in 2010, I'm sure thoughts will be turning on what to wear, where to get married and many more details that will follow to generate your day perfect. Here is a quick look at fashion trends that are emerging in 2010.



Wedding Dress- Long flowing romantic style dresses are very starting to emerge. Soft fabrics, in spite of a floral design are incredibly popular. You can even compliment the dress with a sash. Lace is additionally becoming more and more common among brides. Strapless bridal dress continues to be the most used. Long trains are out, but long veils have returned in this season.



Colors- Purple will be the new blue. Deep plum is apparently the new seasonal favorite for fall of 2010. Brides are needs to purchase lavender accents for upcoming summer and spring collection and so are expected to remain the same thought 2011. There has also been a boost of monochrome weddings rising. Black is extremely formal and stylish. If you choose to go with white and black, consider accenting another color including tiffany blue or fuchsia. This will really make your colors pop!



Reception- A more casual feel for a wedding has become more popular. Use centerpieces of matching colors, and after that have different heights of arrangements (ex: vases). More and more brides are using natural materials like lemons, apples, leaves, etc. Lanterns and flowering veins are as popular as ever. Also, arrangements of ostrich feather centerpieces are becoming more popular.



Wedding Cakes- The past couple of years, elaborate dessert tables and candy bars happen to be very popular. The more traditional wedding cake is setting up a comeback. White classic wedding cakes are what is getting increasingly popular. A good suggestion would be to order just one round, three tier cake with buttercream icing and white fondant. Really make it stand out with the addition of bold flowers to be seen the cake with, with something decorative (antique look) to increase the top of the dessert. You can also go using a simple look and still have it clear at the top of the wedding cake.



Photo Booths- This has been very popular within the last couple of years. I don't see this trend going away soon. You can add a little more "spice" for a photo booth by personalizing it more. Add props for example an old rustic couch. This makes guest feel more comfortable and creates great pictures. Also, offer an assortment of liven up items for example goofy glasses, mustaches, hats, and feather boas.



Remember, this can be a once in a lifetime event. So no matter what exactly is "in style" just follow your heart and turn into true to whom you are.
