      2010 Wedding Trends

     Colors, themes and styles can change year to year in weddings. It used to be that wedding styles didn't change much from year to year. It was normal its the bridesmaids to possess matching dresses and the groomsmen all wore tuxedos. The wedding industry has changes drastically over the past couple of decades. If you are planning on engaged and getting married in 2010, I'm sure thoughts will be turning on fashion, where you might get married and more details that can follow to create your day perfect. Here is a quick look at clothes that are emerging this coming year.



Wedding Dress- Long flowing romantic style dresses are very starting to emerge. Soft fabrics, in spite of a floral design are very popular. You can even compliment clothes with a sash. Lace can also be becoming more and more common among brides. Strapless wedding gown continues to be the most popular. Long trains are out, but long veils are back in this season.



Colors- Purple may be the new blue. Deep plum appears to be the new seasonal favorite for fall of 2010. Brides are starting to purchase lavender accents for upcoming spring and summer collection and therefore are expected to remain the same thought 2011. There has also been a rise of monochrome weddings rising. Black is quite formal and chic. If you choose to go with monochrome, consider accenting another color including tiffany blue or fuchsia. This will really you could make your colors pop!



Reception- A more casual feel to your wedding is becoming more popular. Use centerpieces of matching colors, and then have different heights of arrangements (ex: vases). More and more brides are choosing natural materials including lemons, apples, leaves, etc. Lanterns and flowering veins are as popular as ever. Also, arrangements of ostrich feather centerpieces are becoming widely used.



Wedding Cakes- The past handful of years, elaborate dessert tables and candy bars are already very popular. The more traditional wedding cake is creating a comeback. White classic wedding cakes appear to be what is getting increasingly popular. A good suggestion is to order one particular round, three tier cake with buttercream icing and white fondant. Really make it stand out with the help of bold flowers to decorate the cake with, with something decorative (antique look) to add to the top of the cake. You can also go which has a simple look and have it clear at the top of the wedding cake.



Photo Booths- This has been very popular within the last couple of years. I don't see this trend going away soon. You can add a bit more "spice" for your photo booth by personalizing it more. Add props like an old rustic couch. This makes guest feel convenient and makes for great pictures. Also, provide an assortment of decorate items for example goofy glasses, mustaches, hats, and feather boas.
