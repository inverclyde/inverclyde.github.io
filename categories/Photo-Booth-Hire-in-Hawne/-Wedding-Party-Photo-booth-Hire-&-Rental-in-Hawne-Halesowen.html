      Margot Robbie, Will Smith photo booth photos, Jada Pinkett Smith???s haircut buzz 

Margot Robbie and Will Smith are starring together in the film called Focus, and also the online buzz is always that there are photo-booth photos that got out of control, allegedly showing Smith and Robbie in compromising positions.
The photo booth was setup during the wrap party to the movie, and rumors have spread these photos will show the duo getting too cozy.
The trouble is, these photos haven't leaked online yet, and so we can't really judge for ourselves yet. Popping 'Margot Robbie and Will Smith' and variations of people search terms into Google Images doesn't arrive any photo booth images, mainly only independent photos. (Update: The photos are attached, as shown around the cover of Star.)
Even the professional Getty images rarely show any photos of Robbie and Smith together, this seems like a non sequitur until those pics are in fact leaked online. People who were actually there at the wrap party for the film are claiming it was all innocent fun.
"That was obviously a photo booth on set how the producers got for anyone," a source told Us Magazine.
"It was the last day of filming and everyone was taking photos. They were just goofing around. Will can be like that. There's nothing more into it," they're saying, hopefully putting the divorce and cheating rumors to rest.
Will isn't the only area of the married pair who is making news. Jada Pinkett Smith's new haircut, with buzz cuts sides that seem to be dyed blonde will also be making her name a top trending topic about the search engines.
