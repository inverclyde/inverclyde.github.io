There will probably be little time between each photo in a set and you will just have time for you to switch hats ahead of the flash, so keep your next prop close by.
Be Very Silly: Don't be afraid to create a mixture of photos. Of course there exists room for that romantic ones for all the couples but additionally feel free to pull faces, wear multiple props, wave your Harry Potter wand or have your best Marilyn Monroe pout.
