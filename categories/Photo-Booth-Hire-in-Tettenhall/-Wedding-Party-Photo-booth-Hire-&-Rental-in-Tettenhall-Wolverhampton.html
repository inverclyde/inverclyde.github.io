      Photo Booths: Something old thats new again 

The latest trend in wedding photography has nothing to do with photographers and everything related to entertaining your invited guests. Years ago, photo booths were one of the most popular (and fun!) approaches to have your photo taken. The booths were mainstays at hotels and resorts and beaches and boardwalks&mdash;anywhere people gathered to get a good time. Eventually, new fangled technologies took over along with the photo booth became a thing of the past. Today, photo booths are generating a comeback and they are generally showing up at some unusual places, including receptions. 

	Why rent a photograph booth if you've hired a photographer to capture your special day? First and foremost, photo booths are not meant to replace traditional photographers, but merely to add another part of fun for your event. &ldquo;Getting inside the photo booth your wedding with friends and family&mdash;a few of whom you might not have seen in a lengthy time&mdash;adds to the excitement, as well as the pictures can be oftentimes hilarious and priceless.

	&ldquo;It's absolutely incredible how popular photo booths are in weddings,&rdquo; adds Mark Klein, president, Photo Booth Scrapbooks (fun@photoscrapbooks.com). &ldquo;You can't fully regards until you find it. We use authentic 1950s photo booths. There's a nostalgic feeling people get when they use it that's just magical&mdash;from three-year-olds to 90-year-olds&mdash;they've got so much fun.

Retro or Digital?
There are a variety of photo booths from which to choose. The most popular styles are refurbished vintage machines that produce archival, black-and-white/sepia, four-strip images which are processed directly in the booth with traditional chemistry. Some of the newer models, which resemble tiny studios with wrap-around curtains, utilize digital technology and print color images. But since it is digital, couples will get black-and-white and/or sepia prints, copies, CDs, enlargements, an internet-based photo sharing, too. 
	
Photo booth prices cover anything from $800 for an entire day to get a digital booth around $1,600 for 3 hours for any retro booth, depending on the vendor and also the equipment. The retro machines will set you back because they use real photographic chemistry plus they require a truck to go them (they're heavy), as the new booths typically produce laser prints and may be disassembled for shipping. The majority of vendors provide unlimited photographs, books to paste prints into, with an onsite technician to help you guests work the equipment. 

Klein, whose company rents vintage machines, admits that photo booths may be expensive. &ldquo;Most of the weddings we do are $25,000 or over affairs. It's such as the chocolate fountains,&rdquo; he states. &ldquo;There was a time whenever you hardly ever saw them; it had been such a novel idea. Now they're everywhere and you can even get them at Costco. But that's never going to happen with the photo booth for the reason that price is never going to drop that low.

For those on a strong budget (or those who prefer color), consider renting the newer lightweight, digital booths. &ldquo;Most people, given a choice,&rdquo; states Klein, &ldquo;will pick the old fashion machine. One reason is since the pictures will literally work for a lifetime. But if you can't afford the vintage machine, go with all the digital one.
