A Slow Motion Video Booth has got the same physical appearance as a regular photo booth, but instead of an on-site attendant, you can think of that person as being a skilled "director."  Your guests go into the Slow Motion Video Booth which "director" records them doing whatever they would like for the short time, usually like 8-10 seconds.

Many brides experience the skeptical to start with, due to the fact this is something totally new and something they've not witnessed before.  But anyone who has taken the leap of faith and still have had Slow-Motion Booths at their wedding absolutely rave about it.
As effortlessly hot new trends, you need to watch out for pretenders or people that offer the service with no know-how to accomplish it properly.  There can be a difference in quality.
