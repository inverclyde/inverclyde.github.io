      Slow-Motion Video Booths one of the hottest new trends in receptions 

If you've not seen an image booth at the wedding, well, you then simply have not been to a wedding during the past five years or even more.  Photo booths have become a "must have" at weddings all over the country, giving guests an exciting activity to accomplish while simultaneously providing a nice keepsake and/or favor in the form of a photograph strip.  But the next generation of booths is currently entering the fold:  Please introduce yourself to "Slow Motion Video Booths," a hot new trend that has caught on tremendously about the West Coast, and is just now beginning to trickle in the Michigan market.
Never heard about a Slow Motion Video Booth?  Let me break it down in your case.  Physically, imagine a traditional photo booth, often a 6 x 8 area with curtains, a printer with an on-site attendant who guides your invited guests into the booth area to snap a series of photos, before printing the photos off onto a photo strip that is certainly then given to the guests, or sometimes assembled inside a scrapbook.  A Slow Motion Video Booth has got the same physical appearance as a regular photo booth, but instead of an on-site attendant, you can imagine that person as a skilled "director."  Your guests enter in the Slow Motion Video Booth which "director" records them doing what they have to would like for the short time, usually like 8-10 seconds.  This clip will be slowed down - way down - to where it plays back in super-slow motion.  Instantly (generally), the clip will then be shown on the monitor outside of the booth for all of your invited guests to enjoy.
The reason it has become popular is that it is an exciting and unique experience...you and your guests are now utilized to seeing a regular old photo booth, but everyone is blown away from the slow-motion aspect.  Many companies offering a reverse phone lookup provide unique props that appear to be very cool in slow-motion, like confetti, party poppers, bubbles, etc.  The on-site "director" helps guests in guiding them what to complete to increase the risk for booth experience a lot of fun, but additionally quick, to ensure guests are in and from the booth just like they are with a photo booth.
Many brides experience the skeptical in the beginning, for the reason that this is something totally new and something they've never seen before.  But individuals who have taken the leap of faith and possess had Slow-Motion Booths at their wedding absolutely rave about this.
As with all hot new trends, you have to watch out for pretenders or those who offer the service without the know-how to accomplish it properly.  There is a difference in quality.  One of the few that are doing it properly in Michigan is Complete Video Solutions , who use a special camera to record in the high frame-rate required for high-quality slow-motion.  As for cost, with this company, a Slow-Motion Booth will cost you only a few extra hundred dollars over the cost of a normal Photo Booth.
Believe it or otherwise, but Slow Motion Video Booths will be the cutting edge of hot wedding reception trends, and they're going to be here to keep...so enquire about one for your wedding and turn into amongst the trend-setters in Michigan!
