      Photo booths creating excitement with wedding guests 

When planning your wedding, one of many concerns is always that besides dancing, any alternative activities can guests do to enjoy themselves.  In recent times, the popularity has been to add a photo booth at the reception. 
A photo booth is a good form of entertainment for guests. The photos be the fun memento from the wedding and gives great entertainment for anyone guests who might not be prone to dance.
Photographers and Videographers tend to focus on photographing the pair and the marriage ceremony. Its nearly impossible for them to get a snapshot of each person. Some photo booths may also capture video allowing your guests to record your own message to the couple without having to do it publicly.
One from the elements you would need to decide on is do you need a theme for that props.  Some ideas are if you are planning to a beach location for your honeymoon, use grass skirts, cheesy Hawaiian cups, and fake leis.  If you're having a wedding in the country then incorporate straw hats, a pitch fork, or bits of wheat.  One from the more popular ideas is usually to have chalkboards that guests can write any message they want on there.  They will keep a copy with the photo by leaving one for you which offers a great separate album through the wedding.
Making sure the photo booth company provides what you happen to be looking for is important. Some companies that call themselves photo booths are not- they're a person with a camera and tripod telling website visitors to strike poses. If an image booth costs way lower than other photo booths- you will find there's reason.
When asked, Carly Kotwas, owner of Bow-Tie Booths inside DC area explained concerning the pitfalls of selecting the wrong company.   "If possible, brides are interested in the booth in real life.  Also, they should ask to view examples from the prints. Our prints are what attract brides most. They are 4x6, high quality with custom graphics which are unique and fit the storyline and style of each couple. The prints off their photo booth companies can be much smaller, low resolution in addition to their custom graphics can be plain and boring," Carly said.
Every photo booth is unique so you have to check with company in regards to what you want exactly.  Brides will get unlimited photos and video usage during their rental some time and should expect you'll reserve a 7' x 7' area with an outlet.  On average a photo booth will run around $700 and may be booked as soon as a date and reception location are chosen.
The photo booth is among those wedding celebration elements that everyone will be able to enjoy together which is great added entertainment for your wedding reception guests.
