      How to Make Money with Arts and Crafts by Ernest Kent - ArticleCity.com

I happen to be to many arts and craft fairs and festivals within my life and there?s on thing I notice in most of them. They are busy. If you look closely at what?s happening at these fairs and festivals, you?ll notice that people buy these crafts. I thought to myself ?Why can?t I do that?? Well, guess what happens, I can do that and I do. 

Let me show you how I began in doing arts and crafts. After I visited lots of the arts and crafts fairs and festivals, I went home and decided get some good e-books on making arts and crafts. The first e-book I got involved soap making. I got this e-book because with the last arts and crafts festival I was at, the soaps was the largest sellers. I read the e-book and learned steps to make soap. I got to be effective on making soap for your nest arts and craft festival. I didn?t intend to make a lot of soap at first for anxiety about not selling it all. Well, I made about 100 bars of soap and asked a buddy if I can market at his book. He said yes. I ended up selling 75 bars of soap. I designed a nice little profit from selling the soap. 

After that arts and crafts festival, I went home and got a few more e-books. I got about gel candle making, bath salt making and perfume making. I read all of the e-books and also got busy with making a lot more soap, and I begun to make perfume, bath salt and gel candles. With the research that I did by going to the arts and crafts fairs and festival, I found out the fact that was hot to trade now. 

Anyway, I went back to an alternative arts and crafts festival and found themselves getting my personal booth. I ended up selling almost 10 bars of soap, selling all of the bath salt I made, selling just about 1 gel candle and I sold all perfume I made. That weekend I made about $500 with only putting in $100 in products. I was happy. So I went home and found themselves get another e-book. I got making a wind chime e-book. Well, to make this long story short, I read the e-book made some wind chimes for one more arts and crafts festival. I finished up selling all the wind chimes.

The first e-book I got was about soap making. I got this e-book because at the last arts and crafts festival I was at, the soaps was the biggest sellers. I read the e-book and learned learning to make soap. I got to function on making soap for your nest arts and craft festival. I didn?t want to make a lot of soap to start with for concern with not selling everything. Well, I made about 100 bars of soap and asked an associate if I can market at his book. He said yes. I found themselves selling 75 bars of soap. I developed a nice little cash in on selling the soap. 

After that arts and crafts festival, I went home and also got a few more e-books. I got about gel candle making, bath salt making and perfume making.

Anyway, I went back to a new arts and crafts festival and finished up getting my personal booth. I found themselves selling almost 10 bars of soap, selling each of the bath salt I made, selling almost 1 gel candle and I sold all perfume I made. That weekend I made about $500 with only setting up $100 in products. I was happy. So I went home and finished up get another e-book. I got making a wind chime e-book.
