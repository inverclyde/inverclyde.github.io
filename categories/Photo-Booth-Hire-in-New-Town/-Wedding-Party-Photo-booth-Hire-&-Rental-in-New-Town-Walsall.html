      How to Make Money with Arts and Crafts by Ernest Kent - ArticleCity.com

I happen to be to many arts and craft fairs and festivals inside my life there?s on thing I notice in all of them. They are busy. If you look closely at what?s occurring at these fairs and festivals, you?ll realize that people buy these crafts. I thought to myself ?Why can?t I do that?? Well, guess what happens, I can make this happen and I do. 

Let me tell you how I started in doing arts and crafts. After I visited many of the arts and crafts fairs and festivals, I went home and decided get some e-books on making arts and crafts. The first e-book I got was ready soap making. I got this e-book because in the last arts and crafts festival I was at, the soaps was the most important sellers. I read the e-book and learned making soap. I got to operate on making soap to the nest arts and craft festival. I didn?t want to make a lot of soap initially for concern with not selling it all. Well, I made about 100 bars of soap and asked a buddy if I sell at his book. He said yes. I wound up selling 75 bars of soap. I made a nice little benefit from selling the soap. 

After that arts and crafts festival, I went home and got a few more e-books. I got about gel candle making, bath salt making and perfume making. I read every one of the e-books but got busy with making a lot more soap, and I started to make perfume, bath salt and gel candles. With the research that I did when you go to the arts and crafts fairs and festival, I found out the thing that was hot to market now. 

Anyway, I went back to an alternative arts and crafts festival and finished up getting my own booth. I finished up selling just about 10 bars of soap, selling all of the bath salt I made, selling almost 1 gel candle and I sold all perfume I made. That weekend I made about $500 with only applying $100 in products. I was happy. So I went home and wound up get another e-book. I got making a wind chime e-book. Well, to produce this long story short, I read the e-book made some wind chimes for an additional arts and crafts festival. I wound up selling all of the wind chimes.
