The step to a successful wedding reception is no longer exactly the simple matter of booking the hottest venue and hiring the best DJs. Renting a photo booth is a good way to ensure your event is actually memorable. Of course, the most difficult part for most brides is picking a single booth from the wide variety of Michigan photo booth companies. Now everybody knows how stressful organising a wedding can be, so included below is a simple advice which should make the decision making process that much easier.

Which Michigan Photo Booth Company?

While the selection of an image booth is largely a matter of personal taste, many wedding planners apparently prefer classic-style booths. The outsides of the booths are straight out from the 1950s, and several still utilize the classic dip-and-dunk photographic process to generate 1.5&#8243; by 7.4&#8243; strips. Of course, there are also newer versions offering the classic look while incorporating every one of the bells and whistles that accompany digital-style photography and high quality dye-sublimation printers.

For those that find these old-fashioned vending-style booths a bit unattractive (as do i), there are numerous companies, offering elegantly designed booths that increase the beauty and ambiance of a formal reception even doubling as being a room lighting effect. These booths also provide a variety of extras, including customized film strips that possess a special message or the names in the bride and groom. Their uniquely designed booths arrive using a removable bench seat to allow for larger groups.

Indeed, there's nothing quite like the charm of watching sets of 8 or maybe more friends looking to fit into the booth at the same time in a dead heat to determine who can make the funniest pose. Many couples hold the photo booth placed next to the bar for additional enjoyment. You can even own it near the dance floor to really set things off.

One of the best things about having a photograph booth at the wedding will be the ability to take virtually unlimited photos that truly capture the joy in the moment and also the characters involved. The photo strips make fantastic keepsakes that your particular guests will cherish. Some companies, will give you an attendant to help your guests produce a one-of-a-kind, custom-made scrapbook for the happy couple, no cost, you just provide the book. Unlike traditional guest books, that are little more than an accumulation autographs, these books capture the most memorable and fun portions of your wedding day, as guests contribute their unique favorite shots and messages. The attendant then creates an elegant scrapbook to the clients.

Whatever photo booth company in Michigan you choose, the times of day of enjoyment along with the years of memories it will add to your event will surely be well worth the investment. Recent wedding experience shows, your photo booth reception will require the cake!
