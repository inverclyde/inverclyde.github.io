      2010 Wedding Trends

     Colors, themes and styles can change year to year in weddings. It used to be that wedding styles didn't change much from year to year. It was normal its the bridesmaids to get matching dresses and also the groomsmen all wore tuxedos. The wedding industry has changes drastically in the last couple of decades. If you are planning on marriage in 2010, I'm sure thoughts will probably be turning on getting a great look, where you'll get married and much more details which will follow to generate your day perfect. Here is a glimpse at the latest fashions that are emerging this coming year.



Wedding Dress- Long flowing romantic style dresses can be extremely starting to emerge. Soft fabrics, despite a floral design have become popular. You can even compliment the gown with a sash. Lace can be becoming more and more common among brides. Strapless bridal gown continues to be the most used. Long trains are out, but long veils get home in this season.



Colors- Purple could be the new blue. Deep plum is apparently the new seasonal favorite for fall of 2010. Brides are beginning purchase lavender accents for their upcoming spring and summer collection and therefore are expected to stay the same thought 2011. There has also been a boost of white and black weddings going up. Black is very formal and stylish. If you choose to go with white and black, consider accenting another color such as tiffany blue or fuchsia. This will really you could make your colors pop!



Reception- A more casual feel for a wedding is now more popular. Use centerpieces of matching colors, and after that have different heights of arrangements (ex: vases). More and more brides are using natural materials like lemons, apples, leaves, etc. Lanterns and flowering veins are very popular. Also, arrangements of ostrich feather centerpieces are becoming more popular.



Wedding Cakes- The past handful of years, elaborate dessert tables and candy bars are already very popular. The more traditional wedding cake is building a comeback. White classic wedding cakes seem to be what is getting increasingly popular. A good suggestion would be to order an individual round, three tier cake with buttercream icing and white fondant. Really allow it to be stand out with the help of bold flowers to embellish the cake with, with something decorative (antique look) to add to the top of the dessert. You can also go with a simple look and have it clear at the top of the cake.



Photo Booths- This has been very popular within the last couple of years. I don't see this trend going away anytime soon. You can add more "spice" for your photo booth by personalizing it more. Add props like an old rustic couch. This makes guest feel much more comfortable and makes for great pictures. Also, come with an assortment of dress up items like goofy glasses, mustaches, hats, and feather boas.



Remember, this is the once in a lifetime event. So no matter precisely what is "in style" just follow your heart and stay true to what you are. Have a blast planning your special day!Article Source:  Crawford is often a writer for Wholesale Event Solutions, a firm offering discount wedding and event planning supplies including ostrich plumes, wedding colonnade, wedding centerpieces, and much more!
