    </h2>
    <p>
      Margot Robbie, Will Smith photo booth photos, Jada Pinkett Smith???s haircut buzz 

Margot Robbie and Will Smith are starring together inside a film called Focus, as well as the online buzz is the fact that there are photo-booth photos that got out of hand, allegedly showing Smith and Robbie in compromising positions.
The photo booth was create during the wrap party for that movie, and rumors have spread that these photos will show the duo getting too cozy.
The trouble is, these photos haven't leaked online yet, so we can't really judge for ourselves yet. Popping 'Margot Robbie and Will Smith' and variations of these search terms into Google Images doesn't turn up any photo booth images, mainly only independent photos. (Update: The photos are attached, as shown about the cover of Star.)
Even the professional Getty images rarely show any photos of Robbie and Smith together, so this seems like a non sequitur until those pics are in reality leaked online. People who were actually there at the wrap party for that film are claiming it absolutely was all innocent fun.
"That would have been a photo booth on set that this producers got for everybody," an origin told Us Magazine.
"It was the very last day of filming and everyone was taking pictures. They were just goofing around. Will is the same as that. There's nothing more to it," they're saying, hopefully putting the divorce and cheating rumors unwind.
Will isn't the only section of the married pair that is making news. Jada Pinkett Smith's new haircut, with buzz cuts sides that seem to be dyed blonde will also be making her name a premier trending topic for the search engines.
