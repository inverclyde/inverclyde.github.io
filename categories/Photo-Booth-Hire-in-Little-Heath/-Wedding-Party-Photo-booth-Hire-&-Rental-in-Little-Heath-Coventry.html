      Photo booths creating excitement with wedding guests 

When planning the wedding, one of many concerns is always that besides dancing, any alternative activities can guests do in order to enjoy themselves.  In recent times, the buzz has been to include a photo booth with the reception. 
A photo booth is an excellent form of entertainment for guests. The photos be the fun memento from your wedding and gives great entertainment for those guests who may not be prone to dance.
Photographers and Videographers often focus on photographing the couple and the marriage ceremony. Its almost impossible for them to get a snapshot of the person. Some photo booths can even capture video allowing your guests to record your own message to the couple without having to take action publicly.
One in the elements you would have to decide on is would you like a theme for the props.  Some ideas are if you are going to a beach place for your honeymoon, use grass skirts, cheesy Hawaiian cups, and fake leis.  If you are having a wedding in the nation then incorporate straw hats, a pitch fork, or items of wheat.  One from the more popular ideas would be to have chalkboards that guests can write any message they need on there.  They are able to keep a copy with the photo and then leave one for you which provides a great separate album from your wedding.
Making sure the photo booth company provides what you are looking for is very important. Some businesses that call themselves photo booths are not- they're a person with a camera and tripod telling website visitors to strike poses. If a photo booth costs way lower than other photo booths- you will find there's reason.
When asked, Carly Kotwas, owner of Bow-Tie Booths inside the DC area explained about the pitfalls of deciding on the wrong company.   "If possible, brides need to visit the booth in the real world.  Also, they should ask to view examples with the prints. Our prints are what attract brides most. They are 4x6, excellent with custom graphics which can be unique and fit the storyplot and style of each couple. The prints business photo booth companies could be much smaller, low resolution along with their custom graphics can be plain and boring," Carly said.
Every photo booth is different so you have to check with company about what you want exactly.  Brides will get unlimited photos and video usage throughout their rental some time and should expect you'll reserve a 7' x 7' area by having an outlet.  On average a photo booth will run around $700 and may be booked when a date and reception location are selected.
The photo booth is one kind of those wedding party elements that everybody will be able to enjoy together which is great added entertainment for your wedding reception guests.
