      Photo Booths: Something old thats new again 

The the latest fashion in wedding photography has nothing regarding photographers and everything related to entertaining you and your guests. Years ago, photo booths were probably the most popular (and fun!) methods to have your photo taken. The booths were mainstays at hotels and resorts and beaches and boardwalks&mdash;anywhere people gathered to have a good time. Eventually, new fangled technologies took over and the photo booth became a thing of the past. Today, photo booths are making a comeback and they are generally showing up at some unusual places, including weddings. 

	Why rent a photograph booth once you've hired a photographer to capture your day? First and foremost, photo booths are not meant to replace traditional photographers, however to add another part of fun in your event. &ldquo;Getting inside the photo booth your wedding with friends and family&mdash;some of whom you might not have seen in an extended time&mdash;increases the excitement, and also the pictures are oftentimes hilarious and priceless.

	&ldquo;It's absolutely incredible how popular photo booths are in weddings,&rdquo; adds Mark Klein, president, Photo Booth Scrapbooks (fun@photoscrapbooks.com). &ldquo;You can't fully regards until you see it. We use authentic 1950s photo booths. There's a nostalgic feeling people get after they use it that's just magical&mdash;from three-year-olds to 90-year-olds&mdash;they've got so much fun.

Retro or Digital?
There are a variety of photo booths from which to choose. The most popular styles are refurbished vintage machines that produce archival, black-and-white/sepia, four-strip images which can be processed directly inside the booth with traditional chemistry. Some of the newer models, which resemble tiny studios with wrap-around curtains, utilize digital technology and print color images. But as it's digital, couples will get black-and-white and/or sepia prints, copies, CDs, enlargements, an internet-based photo sharing, too. 
	
Photo booth prices range from $800 to have an entire day for the digital booth around $1,600 for 3 hours for any retro booth, with respect to the vendor along with the equipment. The retro machines can be more expensive because they use real photographic chemistry and they also require a truck to advance them (they're heavy), as the new booths typically produce laser prints and will be disassembled for shipping. The majority of vendors provide unlimited photographs, books to paste prints into, and an onsite technician to help guests work the equipment. 

Klein, whose company rents vintage machines, admits that photo booths might be expensive. &ldquo;Most of the weddings we all do are $25,000 or more affairs. It's like the chocolate fountains,&rdquo; he states. &ldquo;There was a time if you hardly ever saw them; it had been such a novel idea. Now they're everywhere and you may even purchase for them at Costco. But that's never going to happen with all the photo booth since the price is never going to drop that low.

For those on a good budget (or people that prefer color), rent the newer lightweight, digital booths. &ldquo;Most people, given an option,&rdquo; states Klein, &ldquo;will find the old fashion machine. One reason is because the pictures will literally keep going for a lifetime. But if you simply can't afford the vintage machine, go while using digital one.
