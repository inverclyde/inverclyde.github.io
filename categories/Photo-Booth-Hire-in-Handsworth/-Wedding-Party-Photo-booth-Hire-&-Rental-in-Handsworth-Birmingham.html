      How to Make Money with Arts and Crafts by Ernest Kent - ArticleCity.com

I are already to many arts and craft fairs and festivals within my life where there?s on thing I notice in all of them. They are busy. If you take note of what?s going on at these fairs and festivals, you?ll observe that people buy these crafts. I thought to myself ?Why can?t I make this happen?? Well, you know what, I can try this and I do. 

Let me show you how I got started in doing arts and crafts. After I visited most of the arts and crafts fairs and festivals, I went home and decided get some e-books on making arts and crafts. The first e-book I got was ready soap making. I got this e-book because at the last arts and crafts festival I was at, the soaps was the greatest sellers. I read the e-book and learned learning to make soap. I got to operate on making soap to the nest arts and craft festival. I didn?t want to make a lot of soap to start with for anxiety about not selling all of it. Well, I made about 100 bars of soap and asked a friend if I sell at his book. He said yes. I ended up selling 75 bars of soap. I developed a nice little cash in on selling the soap. 

After that arts and crafts festival, I went home but got a few more e-books. I got about gel candle making, bath salt making and perfume making. I read every one of the e-books and also got busy with making more soap, and I begun to make perfume, bath salt and gel candles. With the research that I did by looking at the arts and crafts fairs and festival, I found out what was hot to trade now. 

Anyway, I went back to a new arts and crafts festival and ended up getting my own booth. I finished up selling basically 10 bars of soap, selling each of the bath salt I made, selling basically 1 gel candle and I sold all perfume I made. That weekend I made about $500 with only applying $100 in products. I was happy. So I went home and found themselves get another e-book. I got making a wind chime e-book. Well, to generate this long story short, I read the e-book made some wind chimes for another arts and crafts festival. I wound up selling every one of the wind chimes.
