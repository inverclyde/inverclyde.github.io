Your guests enter the Slow Motion Video Booth and this "director" records them doing anything they would like for a short time, usually like 8-10 seconds.

Instantly (generally), the clip might be shown with a monitor not in the booth for all of your invited guests to enjoy.

Many companies offering the service provide unique props that seem to be very cool in slow-motion, like confetti, party poppers, bubbles, etc.  The on-site "director" helps guests in guiding them what to accomplish to make booth experience tons of fun, but additionally quick, to ensure guests will be in and out of your booth comparable to they are with an image booth.
Many brides experience the skeptical in the beginning, since this is new things and something they've never seen before.  But anyone who has taken the leap of faith and possess had Slow-Motion Booths at their wedding absolutely rave regarding it.
