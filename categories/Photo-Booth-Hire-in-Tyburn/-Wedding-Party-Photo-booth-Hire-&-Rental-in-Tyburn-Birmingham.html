    <p>
      Margot Robbie, Will Smith photo booth photos, Jada Pinkett Smith???s haircut buzz 

Margot Robbie and Will Smith are starring together inside a film called Focus, and also the online buzz is always that there are photo-booth photos that got out of control, allegedly showing Smith and Robbie in compromising positions.
The photo booth was create during the wrap party for the movie, and rumors have spread the photos will demonstrate the duo getting too cozy.
The trouble is, these photos have never leaked online yet, therefore we can't really judge for ourselves yet. Popping 'Margot Robbie and Will Smith' and variations of people search terms into Google Images doesn't generate any photo booth images, mainly only independent photos. (Update: The photos are attached, as shown about the cover of Star.)
Even the professional Getty images rarely show any photos of Robbie and Smith together, and this seems like a non sequitur until those pics are in reality leaked online. People who were actually there at the wrap party for the film are claiming it turned out all innocent fun.
"That was obviously a photo booth on set the producers got for all," a resource told Us Magazine.
"It was the past day of filming and everyone was taking pictures. They were just goofing around. Will is the same as that. There's nothing more for it," a variety offer, hopefully putting the divorce and cheating rumors chill out.
Will isn't the only area of the married pair who is making news. Jada Pinkett Smith's new haircut, with buzz cuts sides that appear to be dyed blonde can also be making her name a high trending topic on the search engines.
