      2010 Wedding Trends

     Colors, themes and styles can change year to year in weddings. It used to be that wedding styles didn't change much from year to year. It was normal its the bridesmaids to possess matching dresses along with the groomsmen all wore tuxedos. The wedding industry has changes drastically over the past couple of decades. If you are planning on marriage in 2010, I'm sure thoughts will likely be turning on what to wear, where you'll get married and more details that will follow to make your day perfect. Here is a glance at fashion trends that are emerging this season.



Wedding Dress- Long flowing romantic style dresses can be extremely starting to emerge. Soft fabrics, in spite of a floral design have become popular. You can even compliment the gown with a sash. Lace is also becoming more and more common among brides. Strapless wedding dress continues to be typically the most popular. Long trains are out, but long veils get home in this season.



Colors- Purple could be the new blue. Deep plum looks like it's the new seasonal favorite for fall of 2010. Brides are needs to purchase lavender accents for his or her upcoming summer collection and so are expected to stay the same thought 2011. There has also been an increase of white and black weddings increasing. Black is very formal and elegant. If you choose to go with monochrome, think of accenting another color for example tiffany blue or fuchsia. This will really help make your colors pop!



Reception- A more casual feel for your wedding is becoming more popular. Use centerpieces of matching colors, after which have different heights of arrangements (ex: vases). More and more brides are using natural materials like lemons, apples, leaves, etc. Lanterns and flowering veins are very popular. Also, arrangements of ostrich feather centerpieces are becoming widely used.



Wedding Cakes- The past handful of years, elaborate dessert tables and candy bars have been very popular. The more traditional wedding cake is creating a comeback. White classic wedding cakes are what is becoming more and more popular. A good suggestion is always to order just one round, three tier cake with buttercream icing and white fondant. Really make it stand out by having bold flowers to brighten the cake with, with something decorative (antique look) to enhance the top of the wedding cake. You can also go using a simple look and have it clear at the top of the dessert.



Photo Booths- This has been very popular during the last couple of years. I don't see this trend going away anytime soon. You can add a tad bit more "spice" for your photo booth by personalizing it more. Add props such as an old rustic couch. This makes guest feel more comfortable and makes for great pictures. Also, come with an assortment of spice up items for example goofy glasses, mustaches, hats, and feather boas.



Remember, this can be a once in a lifetime event. So no matter what's "in style" just follow your heart and stay true to whom you are. Have a blast planning your personal day!Article Source:  Crawford is often a writer for Wholesale Event Solutions, an organization offering discount wedding and event planning supplies including ostrich plumes, wedding colonnade, wedding centerpieces, plus more!
