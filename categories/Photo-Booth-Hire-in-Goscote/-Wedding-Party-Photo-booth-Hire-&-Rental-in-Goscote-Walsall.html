      Slow-Motion Video Booths one of several hottest new trends in wedding receptions 

If you've not seen a photo booth with a wedding, well, you then simply have not been to a wedding in the past five years or maybe more.  Photo booths are becoming a "must have" at wedding receptions all in the country, giving guests a great activity to accomplish while simultaneously providing a great keepsake and/or favor in the form of a photograph strip.  But the next generation of booths is currently entering the fold:  Please introduce yourself to "Slow Motion Video Booths," a hot new trend which includes caught on tremendously on the West Coast, which is just now start to trickle in the Michigan market.
Never been aware of a Slow Motion Video Booth?  Let me break it down to suit your needs.  Physically, create a traditional photo booth, often a 6 x 8 area with curtains, a printer plus an on-site attendant who guides your friends and relatives into the booth area to snap some photos, before printing the photos off onto a photograph strip that is certainly then given to the guests, or sometimes assembled in a scrapbook.  A Slow Motion Video Booth gets the same looks as a conventional photo booth, but instead of an on-site attendant, you can think of that person as a skilled "director."  Your guests type in the Slow Motion Video Booth which "director" records them doing what you would like for any short time, usually like 8-10 seconds.  This clip is then slowed down - way down - to where it plays in super-slow motion.  Instantly (in most cases), the clip might be shown with a monitor not in the booth for all of your guests to enjoy.
The reason it is popular is that it is an exciting and unique experience...your guests are now utilized to seeing a regular old photo booth, but individuals are blown away from the slow-motion aspect.  Many companies offering a reverse phone lookup provide unique props that seem to be very cool in slow-motion, like confetti, party poppers, bubbles, etc.  The on-site "director" helps guests in guiding them what to do to result in the booth experience a lot of fun, but additionally quick, so that guests have been in and out of your booth just like they are with an image booth.
Many brides are skeptical at first, mainly because this is a new challenge and something they've not witnessed before.  But anyone who has taken the leap of faith and have had Slow-Motion Booths at their wedding absolutely rave regarding it.
As wonderful hot new trends, you must watch out for pretenders or those who offer the service minus the know-how to complete it properly.  There is a difference in quality.  One in the few who're doing it properly in Michigan is Complete Video Solutions , who make use of a special camera to record at the high frame-rate needed for high-quality slow-motion.  As for cost, with this company, a Slow-Motion Booth will amount to only a few extra hundred dollars over the cost of a regular Photo Booth.
Believe it or otherwise not, but Slow Motion Video Booths will be the cutting edge of hot wedding celebration trends, and they'll be here to keep...so question one for the wedding and stay amongst the trend-setters in Michigan!
