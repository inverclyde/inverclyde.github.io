      What to Watch Out for When Hiring a Wedding Disc Jockey

It's desperation of every couple having a wedding that their guests feel welcome, relaxed and entertained throughout their big day, which explains why great entertainment is crucial to the success of any wedding reception.  One of the most useful and most financially responsible decisions a marriage coordinator may make is to work with a professional wedding DJ who can do so a lot more than simply provide musical entertainment in the reception.  But just how do a coordinator make certain they've found the most effective?  Here are a number of things to look out for when hiring being married disc jockey.
The first thing to look out for is the source from where the DJ was discovered.  For example, be wary of the DJ that you found on Craigslist or possibly a similar classified advertisement site.  Anyone can advertise on web sites without having their skills and work experience verified and accredited.  It's much wiser to search out talent from your reputable agency with lots of years of experience promoting wedding DJs since they're held accountable for that skills and reliability of each DJ they promote.  With their reputation at risk, they're going to do everything they could to ensure they are only working with the highest quality and quite a few professional disc jockeys around.  
After you've consulted a reputable agency and discovered a few DJs in the area that seem promising, the second thing to look out for is the DJ's history.  You're searching for a DJ with the happiest clients and longest good performing at weddings like yours, so it is in your best interest to book a face-to-face meeting with a few prospects as soon as possible.  During those meetings, you are able to ask for a report on past clients' contact info.  Be wary from a DJ who hesitates to offer you a list upon request.  Call a few past clients and conduct further research in the DJ's website, Facebook and other online profile pages.  If it's tough to find positive reviews or if multiple previous clients give you negative feedback &ndash; you need to look elsewhere.  
The third major thing to consider are hidden fees for services you did not consent to.  When you've found an incredible DJ who are able to provide all of the services you are looking for, it is advisable to get a quote from your DJ that itemizes each and every one of those services, taking into consideration the total height and width of your event space.  These services ranges from adding uplighting, to narrating a photograph or video presentation, to providing a photo booth, etc.  Once the last contract has become drawn up and is also ready to sign by each party, read it carefully and be certain everything required is listed and you are not being charged for what you did not request.  
Watch out because of these simple things and you are clearly sure to hire no person but the very best wedding disc jockey available.
