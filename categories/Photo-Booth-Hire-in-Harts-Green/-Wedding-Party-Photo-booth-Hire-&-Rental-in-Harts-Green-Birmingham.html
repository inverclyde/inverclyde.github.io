      What to Watch Out for When Hiring a Wedding Disc Jockey

It's anticipation of every couple marriage that their guests feel welcome, relaxed and entertained in their big day, which explains why great entertainment is important to the success from a wedding reception.  One of the best and most financially responsible decisions a wedding coordinator may make is to work with a professional wedding DJ who is able to do so a lot more than simply provide musical entertainment during the reception.  But just how do a coordinator make sure they've found the very best?  Here are a number of things to look out for when hiring being married disc jockey.
The first thing to watch out for is the source where the DJ was found.  For example, be wary of the DJ that you found on Craigslist or perhaps a similar classified advertisement site.  Anyone can advertise on web sites without having their skills and work experience verified and accredited.  It's much wiser to seek out talent from a reputable agency with a lot of years of experience promoting wedding DJs since they're held accountable for your skills and reliability of each DJ they promote.  With their reputation at risk, they are going to do everything they could to ensure they are only utilizing the highest quality and most professional disc jockeys around.  
After you've consulted a professional agency and located a few DJs locally that seem promising, the second thing to look out for is the DJ's history.  You're looking for a DJ with all the happiest clients and longest reputation performing at weddings like yours, so it is in your best interest to book a face-to-face meeting with several prospects immediately.  During those meetings, you can ask for a list of past clients' contact details.  Be wary from a DJ who hesitates to offer a list upon request.  Call several past clients and conduct further research with the DJ's website, Facebook or any other online profile pages.  If it's tough to find positive reviews or if multiple previous clients offer you negative feedback &ndash; it's time to look elsewhere.  
The third major thing to take into consideration are hidden fees for services you did not agree to.  When you've found an excellent DJ who can provide all in the services you would like, you need to get a quote in the DJ that itemizes each and every one of those services, taking into account the total sized your event space.  These services do range from adding uplighting, to narrating a photo or video presentation, to providing a photo booth, etc.  Once a final contract continues to be drawn up and is ready to sign by both sides, go through it carefully and be certain all you need is listed and you're not being charged for what you did not request.  
Watch out for these simple things and you're simply sure to hire nobody but the top wedding disc jockey available.
