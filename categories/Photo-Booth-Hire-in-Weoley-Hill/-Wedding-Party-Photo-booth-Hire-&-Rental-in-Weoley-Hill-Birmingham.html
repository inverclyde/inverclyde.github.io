There are photo booths up to rent, and instead of a small enclosed photo area, the photo booths now are open, have a big backdrop instead, where there are props that you can use. For the backdrop, you may make it personalized to contain your business, as well as some, you should use images or perhaps the couple's photo. For the props, they are able to either be full costumes or a great deal of silly hats and colorful wigs. The photos are typically printed immediately so the guests could also take them home as souvenirs in the event.



- Singer or perhaps a Band ? If your budget are able it, or if you've friends or relatives who are singers or have been in a band, you can hire them and do your reception music. No need to hire Celine Dion or Elvis Costello, an upcoming or a budding artist could have a more forgiving talent fee. You can visit recording studios in your area so could get an idea of who to obtain.



- Wine Tasting Station ? No other drink spells romance more than wine. You can create a wine tasting station your reception and also have your guests see and taste the several wines available. The booth must have a sommelier or perhaps an expert that could truly describe and present more information about each wine. This is a twist for the traditional toast ? made more contemporary and fun.



- Chocolate Fountain ? And no other food spells romance greater than chocolate. Have a chocolate fountain in one side of the reception hall, and apart from being a dessert lovers dream, it could easily be a conversational piece in which you can have your guests mingle and heat up to each other. Have a variety of biscuits, fruits and marshmallows as your friends and relatives will indeed be ever coming back again and again.



Receptions is often as simple as an intimate dinner or as exciting as being a party celebration.
