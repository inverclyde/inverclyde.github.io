This is an user friendly program that enables for simple images people and your friends taken right when sitting in front people monitor while you're watching the image form. Here can be a step by step tutorial on how to take a simple picture with all the Photo Booth program making use of the built in camera from the Mac computer.
<!-- INFOLINKS_OFF --> <!-- INFOLINKS_ON -->When you first of all open Photo Booth you will end up given a monitor window which is displaying the look that is appearing right in front of the camera. Below the primary image is a list of different images that you've already taken with Photo Booth in this way, though you will have none here for those who have never used Photo Booth before. In between the look that Photo Booth is collecting with your Mac camera and the listing of past photos is a button with the style of a camera in it. If you click this there might be a three number countdown before all of your screen flashes white and then the new image that's just taken will slide in to the line with the other pictures which were taken in the past.
One from the main items that Photo Booth is renowned for is the 



eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'brighthub_com-netboard-1']));


Photo Booth effects it includes. To the right from the picture button is going to be an <!-- INFOLINKS_OFF --> <!-- INFOLINKS_ON -->Effects button. Once you hit that you'll be taken to a nine pane image of just what the camera is seeing, each which has a different video effect. There will likely be four pages with this: the very first being color and image focused effects, the other being perspective effects for example stretching, the third being background effects like being between the clouds, as well as the third being background effects in places you insert the background image you need. Just click into the effect pane which you want and therefore the camera will come up with that effect, and you will then go through the same picture capture process that's outlined before. When the picture is saved it will be saved with the Photo Booth effect that was chosen and appeared during the style preview.

Go to your "house," which will be the direct position for the user signed in, and select Pictures from the built in options. From there just select the Photo Booth folder and you will probably find the pictures that you simply took in Photo Booth. From here you can transfer them to any location that you simply please.
