      Slow-Motion Video Booths among the hottest new trends in wedding receptions 

If you have not seen a photo booth with a wedding, well, then you certainly simply have not attended a wedding previously five years or even more.  Photo booths are becoming a "must have" at receptions all over the country, giving guests a great activity to accomplish while simultaneously providing a great keepsake and/or favor in the form of an image strip.  But the next generation of booths has become entering the fold:  Please introduce yourself to "Slow Motion Video Booths," a hot new trend which includes caught on tremendously on the West Coast, and it is just now starting to trickle to the Michigan market.
Never heard of a Slow Motion Video Booth?  Let me break it down for you personally.  Physically, imagine a traditional photo booth, usually a 6 x 8 area with curtains, a printer plus an on-site attendant who guides your friends and relatives into the booth area to snap a few photos, before printing the photos off onto a photo strip that is then provided to the guests, or sometimes assembled in a scrapbook.  A Slow Motion Video Booth has the same physical aspect as a traditional photo booth, but instead of an on-site attendant, you can think of that person being a skilled "director."  Your guests enter in the Slow Motion Video Booth which "director" records them doing anything they would like to get a short time, usually like 8-10 seconds.  This clip is then slowed down - way down - to where it plays back in super-slow motion.  Instantly (generally), the clip will then be shown over a monitor outside of the booth for all of your friends and relatives to enjoy.
The reason it may be popular is that it is a great and unique experience...you and your guests are now accustomed to seeing a regular old photo booth, but people are blown away through the slow-motion aspect.  Many companies offering a reverse phone lookup provide unique props that appear to be very cool in slow-motion, like confetti, party poppers, bubbles, etc.  The on-site "director" helps guests in guiding them what to accomplish to increase the risk for booth experience a great deal of fun, and also quick, to ensure that guests will be in and from the booth just like they are with a photo booth.
Many brides find themselves skeptical initially, for the reason that this is new things and something they've never seen before.  But anyone who has taken the leap of faith and possess had Slow-Motion Booths at their wedding absolutely rave about it.
As effortlessly hot new trends, you have to watch out for pretenders or people that offer the service minus the know-how to perform it properly.  There can be a difference in quality.  One of the few who are doing it properly in Michigan is Complete Video Solutions , who use a special camera to record on the high frame-rate necessary for high-quality slow-motion.  As for cost, with this particular company, a Slow-Motion Booth will cost you only a few extra hundred dollars within the cost of a conventional Photo Booth.
Believe it or otherwise not, but Slow Motion Video Booths are the cutting edge of hot wedding celebration trends, and they will be here to be...so ask about one on your wedding and stay amongst the trend-setters in Michigan!
