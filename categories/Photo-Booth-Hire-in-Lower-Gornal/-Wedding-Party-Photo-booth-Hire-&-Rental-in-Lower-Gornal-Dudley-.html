      Slow-Motion Video Booths one of the hottest new trends in receptions 

If you haven't seen a photo booth at a wedding, well, you then simply have not gone to a wedding before five years or even more.  Photo booths are getting to be a "must have" at wedding receptions all on the country, giving guests an enjoyable activity to do while simultaneously providing a pleasant keepsake and/or favor in the form of a photograph strip.  But the next generation of booths is currently entering the fold:  Please introduce yourself to "Slow Motion Video Booths," a hot new trend containing caught on tremendously about the West Coast, and is just now beginning to trickle into the Michigan market.
Never heard about a Slow Motion Video Booth?  Let me break it down to suit your needs.  Physically, make a traditional photo booth, usually a 6 x 8 area with curtains, a printer plus an on-site attendant who guides you and your guests into the booth area to snap a series of photos, before printing the photos off onto a photo strip that is then presented to the guests, or sometimes assembled in the scrapbook.  A Slow Motion Video Booth has got the same physical aspect as a regular photo booth, but instead of an on-site attendant, you can think of that person being a skilled "director."  Your guests type in the Slow Motion Video Booth and also this "director" records them doing what they have to would like for any short time, usually like 8-10 seconds.  This clip will then be slowed down - way down - to where it plays in super-slow motion.  Instantly (in most cases), the clip will then be shown on the monitor outside the booth for all of you and your guests to enjoy.
The reason it has become popular is that it is a great and unique experience...your guests are now utilized to seeing a regular old photo booth, but everyone is blown away from the slow-motion aspect.  Many companies offering the service provide unique props that look very cool in slow-motion, like confetti, party poppers, bubbles, etc.  The on-site "director" helps guests in guiding them what to do to result in the booth experience plenty of fun, but also quick, to ensure that guests have been in and out of the booth just like they are with a photograph booth.
Many brides end up skeptical in the beginning, due to the fact this is something totally new and something they've never witnessed before.  But anyone who has taken the leap of faith and still have had Slow-Motion Booths at their wedding absolutely rave about this.
As wonderful hot new trends, you will need to watch out for pretenders or people that offer the service minus the know-how to complete it properly.  There is really a difference in quality.  One with the few who are doing it properly in Michigan is Complete Video Solutions , who use a special camera to record with the high frame-rate needed for high-quality slow-motion.  As for cost, using this company, a Slow-Motion Booth will cost you only a few extra hundred dollars on the cost of a conventional Photo Booth.
