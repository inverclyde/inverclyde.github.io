      2010 Wedding Trends

     Colors, themes and styles can change year to year in weddings. It used to be that wedding styles didn't change much from year to year. It was normal it really is the bridesmaids to have matching dresses as well as the groomsmen all wore tuxedos. The wedding industry has changes drastically in the last couple of decades. If you are planning on getting married in 2010, I'm sure thoughts is going to be turning on getting a great look, where you'll get married and others details that may follow to generate your day perfect. Here is a glimpse at fashion trends that are emerging in 2010.



Wedding Dress- Long flowing romantic style dresses are very starting to emerge. Soft fabrics, in spite of a floral design are incredibly popular. You can even compliment the dress with a sash. Lace is also becoming more and more common among brides. Strapless bridal dress continues to be the most used. Long trains are out, but long veils have returned in this season.



Colors- Purple could be the new blue. Deep plum looks like it's the new seasonal favorite for fall of 2010. Brides are beginning to purchase lavender accents for upcoming spring and summer collection and they are expected to remain the same thought 2011. There has also been a growth of white and black weddings rising. Black is quite formal and stylish. If you choose to go with black and white, take into consideration accenting another color like tiffany blue or fuchsia. This will really build your colors pop!



Reception- A more casual feel for your wedding is becoming more popular. Use centerpieces of matching colors, and after that have different heights of arrangements (ex: vases). More and more brides are using natural materials for example lemons, apples, leaves, etc. Lanterns and flowering veins are extremely popular. Also, arrangements of ostrich feather centerpieces are becoming very popular.



Wedding Cakes- The past few years, elaborate dessert tables and candy bars are actually very popular. The more traditional wedding cake is building a comeback. White classic wedding cakes appear to be what is becoming a lot more popular. A good suggestion would be to order just one round, three tier cake with buttercream icing and white fondant. Really ensure it is stand out by adding bold flowers to be seen the cake with, with something decorative (antique look) to increase the top of the dessert. You can also go having a simple look and also have it clear at the top of the cake.



Photo Booths- This has been very popular in the last couple of years. I don't see this trend going away soon. You can add a tad bit more "spice" for your photo booth by personalizing it more. Add props including an old rustic couch. This makes guest feel convenient and creates great pictures. Also, provide an assortment of liven up items including goofy glasses, mustaches, hats, and feather boas.
