      Unique Reception Entertainment on Your Wedding Day

     People generally go looking forward to weddings. Whether they are the main entourage or just simply guests, to become a part of this romantic event is truly exciting. For you and your guests, regardless when they've traveled far or have always lived nearby ? how can you keep them entertained instead of sleep with the whole wedding party? Here are some exciting ideas you have in your wedding reception:



- Photo Booth ? Remember those photo booths that you drop a coin, and you also get to do silly poses? You can put an updated version of these photo booths and still have them at your wedding party. There are photo booths up to book, and rather than small enclosed photo area, the photo booths now are open, get this amazing backdrop instead, and there are props which you can use. For the backdrop, you may make it personalized to contain your name, as well as some, you can use images or couple's photo. For the props, they could either be full costumes or a great deal of silly hats and colorful wigs. The photos are usually printed immediately therefore the guests can take them home as souvenirs through the event.



- Singer or possibly a Band ? If your budget have enough money it, or if you have friends or relatives who are singers or are in a band, you can hire them and do your reception music. No need to hire Celine Dion or Elvis Costello, an upcoming or even a budding artist will have a more forgiving talent fee. You can visit recording studios inside your area so could get an idea of who to obtain.



- Wine Tasting Station ? No other drink spells romance over wine. You can setup a wine tasting station at your reception and still have your guests see and taste the various wines available. The booth needs to have a sommelier or even an expert that can truly describe and give more information about each wine. This is a twist on the traditional toast ? made modern-day and fun.



- Chocolate Fountain ? And no other food spells romance greater than chocolate. Have a chocolate fountain in a side of your respective reception hall, and apart from being a dessert lovers dream, it may easily be a conversational piece in places you can have your invited guests mingle and loosen up to each other. Have a variety of biscuits, fruits and marshmallows as your guests will indeed be ever coming back again and again.



Receptions will be as simple just as one intimate dinner or as exciting as a party celebration. Depending on the mood you want to set, it is possible to create that perfect reception atmosphere by choosing the right reception entertainment. Whether a stylish wine tasting booth or a fun photo booth, what's important is that everyone reaches have fun and you get to enjoy the wedding in an ambiance which you truly love.
