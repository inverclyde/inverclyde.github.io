      Slow-Motion Video Booths one of the hottest new trends in weddings 

If have not seen a photograph booth with a wedding, well, you then simply have not attended a wedding before five years or maybe more.  Photo booths are becoming a "must have" at weddings all over the country, giving guests a great activity to complete while simultaneously providing a pleasant keepsake and/or favor in the form of a photo strip.  But the next generation of booths is entering the fold:  Please introduce yourself to "Slow Motion Video Booths," a hot new trend containing caught on tremendously for the West Coast, which is just now starting out trickle to the Michigan market.
Never heard of a Slow Motion Video Booth?  Let me break it down to suit your needs.  Physically, create a traditional photo booth, normally a 6 x 8 area with curtains, a printer plus an on-site attendant who guides your invited guests into the booth area to snap a series of photos, before printing the photos off onto an image strip that is certainly then provided to the guests, or sometimes assembled inside a scrapbook.  A Slow Motion Video Booth has got the same physical appearance as a conventional photo booth, but instead of an on-site attendant, imaginable that person like a skilled "director."  Your guests enter the Slow Motion Video Booth this also "director" records them doing whatever they would like for a short time, usually like 8-10 seconds.  This clip might be slowed down - way down - to where it plays in super-slow motion.  Instantly (in most cases), the clip will then be shown over a monitor outside of the booth for all of your guests to enjoy.
The reason it is popular is that it is a great and unique experience...your invited guests are now utilized to seeing a regular old photo booth, but people are blown away by the slow-motion aspect.  Many companies offering a reverse phone lookup provide unique props that look very cool in slow-motion, like confetti, party poppers, bubbles, etc.  The on-site "director" helps guests in guiding them what to accomplish to result in the booth experience a great deal of fun, but also quick, in order that guests are in and from the booth much like they are with a photograph booth.
Many brides experience the skeptical at first, mainly because this is a new challenge and something they've never seen before.  But those who have taken the leap of faith and still have had Slow-Motion Booths at their wedding absolutely rave about this.
As wonderful hot new trends, you have to watch out for pretenders or those that offer the service with no know-how to do it properly.  There is often a difference in quality.  One of the few that are doing it properly in Michigan is Complete Video Solutions , who work with a special camera to record on the high frame-rate needed for high-quality slow-motion.  As for cost, with this company, a Slow-Motion Booth will amount to only a few extra hundred dollars over the cost of a normal Photo Booth.
Believe it or otherwise, but Slow Motion Video Booths will be the cutting edge of hot wedding party trends, and they're going to be here to stay...so ask about one for your wedding and be amongst the trend-setters in Michigan!
