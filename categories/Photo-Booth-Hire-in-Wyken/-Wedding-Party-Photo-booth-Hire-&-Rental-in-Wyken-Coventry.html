      Photo Booths: Something old thats new again 

The most recent fashion in wedding photography has nothing related to photographers and everything to do with entertaining you and your guests. Years ago, photo booths were one of the most popular (and fun!) approaches to have your photo taken. The booths were mainstays at hotels and resorts and beaches and boardwalks&mdash;anywhere people gathered to possess a good time. Eventually, new fangled technologies took over and the photo booth became a thing of the past. Today, photo booths are generating a comeback and they're showing up at some unusual places, including weddings. 

	Why rent a photo booth when you've hired a photographer to capture your day? First and foremost, photo booths are considered unsuitable to replace traditional photographers, however to add another component of fun to your event. &ldquo;Getting inside photo booth at your wedding with friends and family&mdash;a number of whom you might possibly not have seen in a long time&mdash;adds to the excitement, and the pictures are oftentimes hilarious and priceless.

	&ldquo;It's absolutely incredible how popular photo booths are at weddings,&rdquo; adds Mark Klein, president, Photo Booth Scrapbooks (fun@photoscrapbooks.com). &ldquo;You can't fully be thankful until you find it. We use authentic 1950s photo booths. There's a nostalgic feeling people get when they use it that's just magical&mdash;from three-year-olds to 90-year-olds&mdash;they have got so much fun.

Retro or Digital?
There are a variety of photo booths from which to choose. The most popular styles are refurbished vintage machines that produce archival, black-and-white/sepia, four-strip images which can be processed directly within the booth with traditional chemistry. Some of the newer models, which resemble tiny studios with wrap-around curtains, utilize digital technology and print color images. But because it's digital, couples can get black-and-white and/or sepia prints, copies, CDs, enlargements, and internet-based photo sharing, too. 
	
Photo booth prices cover anything from $800 to have an entire day for the digital booth as much as $1,600 for 3 hours for a retro booth, with respect to the vendor as well as the equipment. The retro machines will set you back because they use real photographic chemistry and they also require a truck to go them (they're heavy), as the new booths typically produce laser prints and can be disassembled for shipping. The majority of vendors provide unlimited photographs, books to paste prints into, as well as an onsite technician to aid guests work the equipment. 

Klein, whose company rents vintage machines, admits that photo booths might be expensive. &ldquo;Most of the weddings perform are $25,000 and up affairs. It's like the chocolate fountains,&rdquo; he states. &ldquo;There was a time whenever you hardly ever saw them; it turned out such a novel idea. Now they're everywhere and you can even buy them at Costco. But that's never going to happen with the photo booth since the price is never going to drop that low.

For those on a strong budget (or those that prefer color), consider renting the newer lightweight, digital booths. &ldquo;Most people, given a choice,&rdquo; states Klein, &ldquo;will pick the old fashion machine. One reason is as the pictures will literally serve you for a lifetime. But if you can't afford the vintage machine, go with the digital one.
