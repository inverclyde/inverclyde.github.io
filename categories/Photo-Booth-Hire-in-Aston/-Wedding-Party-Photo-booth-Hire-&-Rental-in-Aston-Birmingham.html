      2010 Wedding Trends

     Colors, themes and designs can change year to year in weddings. It used to be that wedding styles didn't change much from year to year. It was normal for all of the bridesmaids to get matching dresses along with the groomsmen all wore tuxedos. The wedding industry has changes drastically in the last couple of decades. If you are planning on getting married in 2010, I'm sure thoughts will be turning on getting a great look, where you get married and others details that may follow to produce your day perfect. Here is a quick look at clothes that are emerging this year.



Wedding Dress- Long flowing romantic style dresses are very starting to emerge. Soft fabrics, in spite of a floral design are extremely popular. You can even compliment the dress with a sash. Lace can also be becoming more and more common among brides. Strapless bridal dress continues to be the most used. Long trains are out, but long veils are back in this season.



Colors- Purple will be the new blue. Deep plum looks like it's the new seasonal favorite for fall of 2010. Brides are starting to purchase lavender accents for upcoming spring and summer collection and so are expected to stay the same thought 2011. There has also been an increase of monochrome weddings increasing. Black is extremely formal and chic. If you choose to go with white and black, take into consideration accenting another color such as tiffany blue or fuchsia. This will really make your colors pop!



Reception- A more casual feel for your wedding is becoming more popular. Use centerpieces of matching colors, and after that have different heights of arrangements (ex: vases). More and more brides are employing natural materials like lemons, apples, leaves, etc. Lanterns and flowering veins are extremely popular. Also, arrangements of ostrich feather centerpieces are becoming very popular.



Wedding Cakes- The past handful of years, elaborate dessert tables and candy bars have been very popular. The more traditional wedding cake is making a comeback. White classic wedding cakes appear to be what is becoming a lot more popular. A good suggestion is usually to order one particular round, three tier cake with buttercream icing and white fondant. Really make it stand out by adding bold flowers to be seen the cake with, with something decorative (antique look) to increase the top of the dessert. You can also go having a simple look and still have it clear at the top of the wedding cake.



Photo Booths- This has been very popular during the last couple of years. I don't see this trend going away anytime soon. You can add a tad bit more "spice" to your photo booth by personalizing it more. Add props including an old rustic couch. This makes guest feel convenient and tends to make great pictures. Also, offer an assortment of spice up items such as goofy glasses, mustaches, hats, and feather boas.



Remember, this is a once in a lifetime event. So no matter precisely what is "in style" just follow your heart and remain true to what you are. Have a blast planning your personal day!Article Source:  Crawford is a writer for Wholesale Event Solutions, a firm offering discount wedding and event planning supplies including ostrich plumes, wedding colonnade, wedding centerpieces, and much more!
