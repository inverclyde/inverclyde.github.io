      Photo Booth in Gibbet Hill Coventry
    </h2>
    <p>
      Margot Robbie, Will Smith photo booth photos, Jada Pinkett Smith???s haircut buzz 

Margot Robbie and Will Smith are starring together in a film called Focus, and also the online buzz is there are photo-booth photos that got out of control, allegedly showing Smith and Robbie in compromising positions.
The photo booth was set up during the wrap party to the movie, and rumors have spread that these photos can have the duo getting too cozy.
The trouble is, these photos have never leaked online yet, therefore we can't really judge for ourselves yet. Popping 'Margot Robbie and Will Smith' and variations of these search terms into Google Images doesn't show up any photo booth images, mainly only independent photos. (Update: The photos are attached, as shown around the cover of Star.)
Even the professional Getty images rarely show any photos of Robbie and Smith together, which means this seems like a non sequitur until those pics are in reality leaked online. People who were actually there with the wrap party to the film are claiming it turned out all innocent fun.
"That would be a photo booth on set the producers got for all," a resource told Us Magazine.
"It was the last day of filming and everyone was capturing. They were just goofing around. Will can be like that. There's nothing more for it," they're saying, hopefully putting the divorce and cheating rumors to relax.
Will isn't only section of the married pair that's making news. Jada Pinkett Smith's new haircut, with buzz cuts sides that seem to be dyed blonde will also be making her name a top trending topic about the search engines.
